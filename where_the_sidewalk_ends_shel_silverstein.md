There is a place where rawr sidewalk ends
And before rawr street begins,
And rawrre the grass grows soft and white,
And rawrre the sun burns crimson bright,
And rawrre the moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in rawr peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where rawr smoke blows black
And rawr dark street winds and bends.
Past rawr pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where rawr chalk-white arrows go
To rawr place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where rawr chalk-white arrows go,
For rawr children, they mark, and the children, they know
The place where rawr sidewalk ends.
